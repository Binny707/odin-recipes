            <li>2 big sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tahini</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp. maple syrup</li>
            <li>water <em>(to thin dressing)</em></li>
            <li>230g chickpeas, drained</li> 
            <li>1 tsp. cumin powder</li> 
            <li>1/2 tsp. garlic powder</li> 
            <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li> 
            <li>1/2 tsp. chili</li> 
            <li>3 cup kale</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat up oven to <strong>400 degress F</strong></li>
            <li>Cut the sweet potatoes into cubes or slices, whichever is prefered. 
                Put them in a bowl and mix in some olive oil. Toss the oil around
                along with the olive oil. Spread the potato pieces on a large baking pan lined with 
                parchement paper</li>
            <li>Cute the red onion into pieces as well. Place them in the same bowl you
                used for your sweet potatoes. Swirl the red onion in the bowl to get some 
                leftover olive oil use on the sweet potatoes. Spread the red onion on same baking pan 
                with sweet potatoes.</li>
            <li>Put pan with red onion and sweet potato in oven. Bake for <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>While potato and red onion bake, we will prepare the chickpeas. In a sauce pan, 
                add your chickepeas. Top the chickpeas with cumin powder, garlic powder, salt, and chili. 
                Fold the spices into the chickpeas with a spatula to evenly coat all of them. Roast 
                ckickpeas in that same pan on medium heat. Heat them up until soft, firm, or hard, depending
                on your preference. Once chickpeas are fully cooked to your liking, remove and put into 
                another container. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Now add fresh kale to that same sauce pan and add a splash of water. Heat 
                saucepan on medium heat. The water should start evaporating and the kale should
                start softening and becoming smaller. Turn off heat once all kale has reached that
                desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Now we will make the dressing. In a small bowl, mix tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup.
                As yo umix it, you'll notice the consistency thicken. Add a splash of water and mix. Continue 
                adding increments of water until the mixture turns into a saucy consistency.</li>
            <li>Put the cooked kale in a bowl now, top it off with the cooked chickpeas, sweet potato,
                and red onion. Drizzel some of that tahini sauce and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
